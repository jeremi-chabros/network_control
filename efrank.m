function erank = erank(A)

% This script is an adaptation of the effective rank as by definition in
% Roy & Vetterli (2007)

% Input:
% adjM - adjacency matrix of the size N x N, where N represents the number
% of nodes in a network. adjM needs to be symmetrical and real-valued

% Output:
% erank - value of effective rank
